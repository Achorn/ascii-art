## Overview

### The challenge

Write and host a web application which asks the user for a vertical size, and then prints the letters “AC”, using their respective letters, to fill that height, at a letter line width ratio of 1 wide for every 4 high, with a minimum letter line size of 1.

For instance, if asked to print in size 8:

```
        AA             CCCCCCC
       AAAA           CCCCCCCCC
      AA  AA         CC
     AAAAAAAA        CC
    AAAAAAAAAA       CC
   AA        AA      CC
  AA          AA      CCCCCCCCC
 AA            AA      CCCCCCC
```

For instance, if asked to print in size 3:

```
   A    CCC
  AAA  C
 A   A  CCC
```

Requirements:

- Use any language you are comfortable with. We use Dart for frontend work, so if you’re comfortable with that, use it.
- Don’t use any imports outside of the standard library for functionality. HTTP calls may be handled through a third party if this is part of your implementation.
- Code should be well formatted and documented so it is readable and maintainable.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Web-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Not much learning anything I didn't know, but was able to impliment intuitive strategies to scale the characters.

This trim function takes blocky ascii art that was scaled from a character of a height of 4 then smooths out the sides.

```js
function trimA(arr, lWidth) {
  for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let disp = lWidth - (i % lWidth) - 1;
    let newArr = arr[i].slice();
    for (let j = 0; j < disp; j++) {
      newArr.pop();
      newArr.unshift(" ");
    }
    arr[i] = newArr;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

what I would do if took more time

- find a better way to scale the font of the ascii art.
-

### Useful resources

- [Easy 2D array scaling](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49620245/how-to-scale-a-two-dimensional-array-in-javascript-fast) - grabbed a quick 2d array scaler from stack overflow. basically doubled the array vertically and horizontally.

- [Monospacing for HTML Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_tt.asp) - defined the teletype/monospace for the P element contains the ascii art for appropriate spacing.

- [Preserve spacing in HTML](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18427697/how-to-keep-all-the-spaces-in-a-string) - preserved spacing in HTML by using white-space: pre.
