## Overview

### The challenge

Write and host a web application which asks the user for a vertical size, and then prints the letters “AC”, using their respective letters, to fill that height, at a letter line width ratio of 1 wide for every 4 high, with a minimum letter line size of 1.

For instance, if asked to print in size 8:

```
        AA             CCCCCCC
       AAAA           CCCCCCCCC
      AA  AA         CC
     AAAAAAAA        CC
    AAAAAAAAAA       CC
   AA        AA      CC
  AA          AA      CCCCCCCCC
 AA            AA      CCCCCCC
```

For instance, if asked to print in size 3:

```
   A    CCC
  AAA  C
 A   A  CCC
```

Requirements:

- Use any language you are comfortable with. We use Dart for frontend work, so if you’re comfortable with that, use it.
- Don’t use any imports outside of the standard library for functionality. HTTP calls may be handled through a third party if this is part of your implementation.
- Code should be well formatted and documented so it is readable and maintainable.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Web-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Used this challenge to reinforce fundamental practices for html and css. I also used flex-grow on the card componenents in order to keep the cards uniform and to have the button on the bottom of the card.

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  padding: 55px;
  height: 370px;
}
/* paragraph fills the majority of the card */
p {
  color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
  line-height: 2;
  flex-grow: 4;
}
```
